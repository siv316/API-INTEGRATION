"DESCRIPTION": I have learned from this program is a simple weather dashboard web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Features:

User Input: Allows the user to input the name of a city.

Weather Data Fetching: When the user clicks "Get Weather", it fetches the current weather data for that city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Data Display: Displays the following weather information:

City and country name

Weather description

Temperature in Celsius

Humidity percentage

Wind speed in meters per second


Responsive Design: The layout adapts for smaller screen sizes (like mobile devices).


Components Breakdown:

HTML: Provides the structure of the page, including input, button, and output display elements.

CSS: Styles the page to make it visually appealing, with a centered card-like container and responsive adjustments.

JavaScript: Handles the logic for fetching weather data from the API, error handling, and dynamically updating the DOM with the retrieved data.
